MudCartographer is a simple MUD mapping utility that allows users to create rooms simply by navigating with the arrow/num pad keys. Various bits of information and color can be added to rooms.

At the request of an AlexMUD builder I've added support for creating AlexMUD world files. If you have a MUD that you'd like MudCartographer to work with, send me a gmail.
